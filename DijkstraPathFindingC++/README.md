# C++ Project: A 2D Grid Shortest Path Finder

Pet project to participate in a challenge for a hiring process of Paradox. This project includes the following classes:

- DebugUtils: Many unity tests with a good coverage of most of the path finder situations.
- MathUtils: Matrix transposition, Manhattan distance, and other calculations on matrices.
- FindPath: Dijkstra algorithm for PathFinder, with edge cases and some optimizations.
- MovementUtils: Helper that checks which tiles are available to move given a position on the board.
